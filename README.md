Predicting cancer mortality rates in US counties

The dataset comprises data collected from multiple counties in the US. The regression task for this assessment is to predict cancer mortality rates in "unseen" US counties, given some training data. The training data ('Training_data.csv') comprises various features/predictors related to socio-economic characteristics, amongst other types of information for specific counties in the country. The corresponding target variables for the training set are provided in a separate CSV file ('Training_data_targets.csv').
